This is a simple script that allows to watch a CyberPower UPS by USB (without using the proprietary software from the vendor).

I use it to export my UPS status into Prometheus:

- You can use it without root (careful, some of these can be turned off by USB, so giving access to non-root would also give them the right to do so)
- You can use it on non x86 platforms.
- You can use it because it is Free.

One of the problem I found is that there is no serial number in these units, or
at least not accessible by USB meaning you cannot recognize which unit is which
just by using USB. In my case, the firmware is giving two different versions so
I use that to distinguish them (maybe they are serial after all).

For now, it only manages the PR3000LCDRTXL2U model, but it should be trivial to
support others that use the same HID approach.

* Use with prometheus
#+BEGIN_CODE shell
virtualenv --python=python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run server.py
#+END_CODE
the metrics will be available on http://127.0.0.1:9500/metrics

* Useful docs

There was no need to reverse engineer, the device is using a standardized HID protocol.

https://usb.org/sites/default/files/pdcv10.pdf : The official HID tables for Power devices.

* Example of output as json (default for usb.py)

#+BEGIN_CODE json

* What to do if you use a different model

  In the code, change VENDOR_ID and PRODUCT_ID to match your product.
